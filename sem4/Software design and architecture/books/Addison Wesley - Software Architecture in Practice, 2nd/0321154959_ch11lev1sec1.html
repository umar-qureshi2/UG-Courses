<P class="docText">The ATAM requires the participation and mutual cooperation of three groups:</P>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><OL class="docList" TYPE="1">
<LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">The evaluation team.</span> 
This group is external to the project whose architecture is being evaluated. It usually consists of three to five people. Each member of the team is assigned a number of specific roles to play during the evaluation. (See <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch11table01">Table 11.1</A> for a description of these roles, along with a set of desirable characteristics for each.) The evaluation team may be a standing unit in which architecture evaluations are regularly performed, or its members may be chosen from a pool of architecturally savvy individuals for the occasion. They may work for the same organization as the development team whose architecture is on the table, or they may be outside consultants. In any case, they need to be recognized as competent, unbiased outsiders with no hidden agendas or axes to grind.</p></span></LI>
<LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Project decision makers.</span> 
These people are empowered to speak for the development project or have the authority to mandate changes to it. They usually include the project manager, and, if there is an identifiable customer who is footing the bill for the development, he or she will be present (or represented) as well. The architect is always included—a cardinal rule of architecture evaluation is that the architect must willingly participate. Finally, the person commissioning the evaluation is usually empowered to speak for the development project; even if not, he or she should be included in the group.</p></span></LI>
<LI><span style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Architecture stakeholders.</span> 
Stakeholders have a vested interest in the architecture performing as advertised. They are the ones whose ability to do their jobs hinges on the architecture promoting modifiability, security, high reliability, or the like. Stakeholders include developers, testers, integrators, maintainers, performance engineers, users, builders of systems interacting with the one under consideration, and others. Their job during an evaluation is to articulate the specific quality attribute goals that the architecture should meet in order for the system to be considered a success. A rule of thumb—and that is all it is—is that you should expect to enlist the services of twelve to fifteen stakeholders for the evaluation.</p></span></LI>
