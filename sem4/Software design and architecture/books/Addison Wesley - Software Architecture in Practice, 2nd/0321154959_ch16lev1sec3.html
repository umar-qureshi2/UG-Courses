<P class="docText">Sun Microsystem's approach to satisfying the quality attributes discussed in the previous section is through the specification of two major architectures: J2EE and the EJB. J2EE describes the overall multi-tier architecture for designing, developing, and deploying component-based, enterprise-wide applications. EJB is a key part of J2EE technology, reflecting the deeper technical requirements of buildability, extensibility, and interoperability. Both J2EE and EJB reflect balanced specificity듮hat is, the ability for competitors to develop differentiation on the offerings while building them on a common base.</P>

<P class="docText">The role of each tier is as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Client tier.</span> 
In a Web application, the client tier comprises an Internet browser that submits HTTP requests and downloads HTML pages from a Web server. In an application not deployed using a browser, standalone Java clients or applets can be used; these communicate directly with the business component tier. (See <A class="docLink" HREF="0321154959_ch17.html#ch17">Chapter 17</A> for an example of using J2EE without a browser.)</p>
</LI>
<LI><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Web tier.</span> 
The Web tier runs a Web server to handle client requests and responds to these requests by invoking J2EE servlets or JavaServer Pages (JSPs). Servlets are invoked by the server depending on the type of user request. They query the business logic tier for the required information to satisfy the request and then format the information for return to the user via the server. JSPs are static HTML pages that contain snippets of servlet code. The code is invoked by the JSP mechanism and takes responsibility for formatting the dynamic portion of the page.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Business component tier.</span> 
The business components comprise the core business logic for the application. They are realized by EJBs (the software component model supported by J2EE). EJBs receive requests from servlets in the Web tier, satisfy them usually by accessing some data sources, and return the results to the servlet. EJB components are hosted by a J2EE environment known as the EJB container, which supplies a number of services to the EJBs it hosts including transaction and life-cycle management, state management, security, multi-threading, and resource pooling. EJBs simply specify the type of behavior they require from the container at runtime and then rely on the container to provide the services. This frees the application programmer from cluttering the business logic with code to handle system and environmental issues.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Enterprise information systems tier.</span> 
This typically consists of one or more databases and back-end applications like mainframes and other legacy systems, which EJBs must query to process requests. JDBC drivers are typically used for databases, which are most often Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).</p>
</LI>
</UL>
<A NAME="ch16lev2sec2"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title"> THE EJB ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH</H4>
<P class="docText">The remainder of this chapter focuses on the Enterprise JavaBeans architecture, which defines a standard programming model for constructing distributed object-oriented server-side Java applications. Because this programming model is standard, many beans that prepackage useful functionality can be (and have been) written. The EJB programmer's job is to bundle these packages with any application-specific functionality to create a complete application.</P>
<P class="docText">Not unlike J2EE, EJBs aim at realizing one of Java's major design principles듮he oft-quoted "Write Once, Run Anywhere" mantra. The JVM allows a Java application to run on any operating system. However, server components require additional services that are not supplied directly by the JVM, such as transaction and security services. In J2EE and EJB, these services are supplied through a set of standard vendor-independent interfaces that provide access to the additional supporting infrastructure, which together form the services available in an application server.</P>
<P class="docText">A J2EE-compliant application server provides an EJB <span class="docEmphasis">container</span> to manage the execution of application components. In practical terms, a container provides an operating system process that hosts one or (usually) more EJB components. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16fig03">Figure 16.3</A> shows the relationship between an application server, a container, and the services provided. In brief, when a client invokes a server component the container automatically allocates a thread and invokes an instance of the component. The container manages all resources on the component's behalf and manages all interactions between the component and the external systems.</P>
<CENTER><H5 class="docFigureTitle"><A NAME="ch16fig03"></A>Figure 16.3. Example deployment view of the EJB architecture</H5><p class="docText"><IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="335" src="FILES/16fig03.gif" ALT="graphics/16fig03.gif"></p>
</CENTER>
<P class="docText">The EJB component model defines the basic architecture of an EJB component, specifying the structure of its interfaces and the mechanisms by which it interacts with its container and other components. The model also provides guidelines for developing components that can work together to form a larger application.</P>
<P class="docText">The EJB version 1.1 specification defines two main types of components: <span class="docEmphasis">session beans</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">entity beans</span>.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Session beans</span> typically contain business logic and provide services for clients. The two types of session bean are known as <span class="docEmphasis">stateless</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">stateful</span>.</P><DL>
<DD><P class="docList">- A <span class="docEmphasis">stateless session bean</span> is defined as not being <span class="docEmphasis">conversational</span> with respect to its calling process. This means that it does not keep any state information on behalf of any client. A client will get a reference to a state less session bean in a container and can use it to make many calls on an instance of the bean. However, between each successive service invocation, a client is not guaranteed to bind to any particular stateless session bean instance. The EJB container delegates client calls to stateless session beans <span class="docEmphasis">as needed</span>, so the client can never be certain which bean instance it will actually talk to. This makes it meaningless to store client-related state in a stateless session bean.</P></DD><DD><P class="docList">- A <span class="docEmphasis">stateful session bean</span> is said to be conversational with respect to its calling process and therefore can maintain state information about the conversation. Once a client gets a reference to a stateful session bean, all subsequent calls to the bean using this reference are guaranteed to go to the same bean instance. The container creates a new, dedicated stateful session bean for each client that creates a bean instance. Thus, clients can store any state information they wish in the bean and can be assured that it will still be there the next time they access that bean. EJB containers assume responsibility for managing the life cycle of stateful session beans. The container writes out a bean's state to disk if it has not been used for a while and automatically restores the state when the client makes a subsequent call on the bean. This mechanism is known as <span class="docEmphasis">passivation and activation</span> of the stateful bean. We will discuss passivation in more detail later.</P></DD></DL></LI>
<LI><P class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Entity beans</span> are typically used for representing business data objects. The data members in an entity bean map directly to some data items stored in an associated database. Entity beans are usually accessed by a session bean that provides business-level client services. There are two types of entity bean, <span class="docEmphasis">container-managed persistence</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">bean-managed persistence</span>. Persistence in this context refers to the way in which a bean's data (usually a row in a relational database table) is read and written.</P><DL>
<DD><P class="docList">- With <span class="docEmphasis">container-managed persistence entity beans</span>, the data the bean represents is mapped automatically to the associated persistent data store (e.g., a database) by the container. The container is responsible for loading the data to the bean instance and writing changes back to the persistent data storage at appropriate times, such as the start and end of a transaction. Container-managed persistence relies on container-provided services and requires no application code듮he container in fact generates the data access code so it is easy to implement.</P></DD><DD><P class="docList">- With <span class="docEmphasis">bean-managed persistence entity beans</span>, the bean code itself is responsible for accessing the persistent data it represents, typically using handcrafted JDBC calls. Bean-managed persistence gives the bean developer the flexibility to perform persistence operations that are too complicated for the container or to use a data source not supported by the container듡or example, a custom or legacy database. While bean-managed persistence requires more programmer effort to implement, it can some times provide opportunities to optimize data access and, in such cases, may provide better performance than container-managed persistence.</P></DD></DL></LI>

<A NAME="ch16lev2sec3"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title"> EJB PROGRAMMING</H4>
<P class="docText">An EJB depends on its container for all external information. If an EJB needs to access a JDBC connection or another bean, it uses container services. Accessing the identity of its caller, obtaining a reference to itself, and accessing properties are all accomplished through container services. This is an example of an "intermediary" tactic. The bean interacts with its container through one of three mechanisms: callback methods, the <TT>EJBContext</TT> interface, and the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI).</P>
<P class="docText">To create an EJB server-side component, the developer must provide two interfaces that define a bean's business methods, plus the actual bean implementation class. The two interfaces, <TT>remote</TT> and <TT>home</TT>, are shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16fig05">Figure 16.5</A>. Clients use them to access a bean inside an EJB container. They expose the capabilities of the bean and provide all the methods needed to create the bean and update, interact with, or delete it.</P>
<CENTER><H5 class="docFigureTitle"><A NAME="ch16fig05"></A>Figure 16.5. EJB package diagram</H5><p class="docText"><IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="256" src="FILES/16fig05.gif" ALT="graphics/16fig05.gif"></p>
</CENTER>
<P class="docText">The two interfaces have different purposes. <TT>Home</TT> contains the life-cycle methods of the EJB, which provide clients with services to create, destroy and find bean instances. In contrast, <TT>remote</TT> contains the business methods offered by the bean. These methods are application specific. To use them in the bean's <TT>remote</TT> interface, clients must use the bean's <TT>home</TT> interface to obtain a reference to the <TT>remote</TT> interface.</P>
<P class="docText">A simple <TT>home</TT> interface is shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16list01">Figure 16.6</A>. It must inherit from <TT>EJBHome</TT> and, in this example, contains a method to create an EJB of type <TT>Broker</TT>. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16list02">Figure 16.7</A> shows the <TT>remote</TT> interface for the <TT>Broker</TT> EJB.</P>
<P class="docText"><TT>Remote</TT> interfaces must extend the <TT>EJBObject</TT> interface, which contains a number of methods that the container uses to manage an EJB's creation and life cycle. A programmer may wish to provide bean-specific behavior for the EJB, or may simply accept the default, inherited behavior. The client then uses <TT>public</TT> interfaces to create, manipulate, and remove beans from the EJB server. The implementation class, normally known as the bean class, is instantiated at runtime and becomes an accessible distributed object. Some sample client code, simplified, is shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16list03">Figure 16.8</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">EJB clients may be standalone applications, servlets, applets, or even other EJBs, as we will see shortly. All clients use the server bean's <TT>home</TT> interface to obtain a reference to an instance of the server bean. This reference is associated with the class type of the server bean's <TT>remote</TT> interface; so the client interacts with the server bean entirely through the methods defined in its <TT>remote</TT> interface.</P>
<P class="docText">In this next example, the <TT>Broker</TT> bean is acting as a stateless session bean that handles all client requests. Internally, it uses the services of a number of entity beans to perform the business logic. A sample of one of the <TT>Broker</TT> methods, <TT>updateAccount</TT>, is shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16list04">Figure 16.9</A>.</P>
<P class="docText">The <TT>updateAccount</TT> method uses an entity bean called <TT>Account</TT>, which encapsulates all of the detailed manipulation of the application's data들n this case, exactly how an account record is updated. The code in <TT>updateAccount</TT> uses an entity bean <TT>finder</TT> method called <TT>findByPrimaryKey</TT>, which is provided by the <TT>Account</TT> bean in its <TT>home</TT> interface. This method takes the primary key for the account and accesses the underlying database. If an account record is found in the database with this primary key, the EJB container creates an <TT>Account</TT> entity bean. The entity bean methods들n this example <TT>update</TT>-can then be used to access the data in the account record. The <TT>home</TT> and <TT>remote</TT> interfaces for <TT>Account</TT> are shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16list05">Figure 16.10</A>.</P>

<P class="docText">The bean class for the entity bean implements the remote methods. The code for the <TT>update</TT> method is shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16list06">Figure 16.11</A>. It is very simple들n fact, a single line of executable Java code. This simplicity is due to the entity bean's use of <span class="docEmphasis">container-managed persistence</span>. The EJB container "knows" (we will see how soon) that there is a correspondence between the data members in the <TT>Account</TT> bean and the fields in an account table in the database the application is using.</P>
<P class="docText">Using this information, the container tools can generate the SQL queries needed to implement the <TT>finder</TT> method, and the queries needed to automatically read/write the data from/to the entity bean at the beginning/end of a transaction. In this example, at the end of the <TT>Broker</TT> session bean's <TT>updateAccount</TT> method, the data items in the <TT>Account</TT> entity bean are written back to the database, making the changes to the <TT>sub_credit</TT> field persistent. All of this is done without explicit control from the programmer, which contributes to the buildability of EJB-based systems.</P>

<P class="docText">One of the major attractions of the EJB model is the way it achieves a separation of concerns between the business logic and the infrastructure code, an example of the "semantic coherence" tactic. This separation refers to the fact that EJBs are primarily concerned with pure business logic while the EJB container handles environmental and infrastructure issues such as transactions, bean life-cycle management, and security. This makes the bean components simpler듮hey are not littered with code to handle these additional complexities.</P>
<P class="docText">A bean tells the container which of the provided services it requires through a deployment descriptor. This is an XML document associated with an EJB. When a bean is deployed in a container, the container reads the deployment descriptor to find out how transactions, persistence (for entity beans), and access control should be handled. In this way the descriptor provides a declarative mechanism for how these issues are handled드n example of the "defer binding time" tactic.</P>
<P class="docText">The beauty of this mechanism is that the same EJB component can be deployed with different descriptors suited to different application environments. If security is an issue, the component can specify its access control needs. If security is not an issue, no access control is specified. In both cases the code in the EJB is identical.</P>
<P class="docText">A deployment descriptor has a predefined format that all EJB-compliant beans must use and that all EJB-compliant servers must know how to read. This format is specified in an XML Document Type Definition, or DTD. The deployment descriptor describes the type of bean (session or entity) and the classes used for <TT>remote</TT>, <TT>home</TT>, and the bean class. It also specifies the transactional attributes of every method in the bean, which security roles can access each method (access control), and whether persistence in the entity beans is handled automatically by the container or performed explicitly by the bean code.</P>
<P class="docText">The deployment descriptor for the <TT>Broker</TT> bean shown before is given in <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16list07">Figure 16.12</A>. In addition to the attributes described, the deployment descriptor specifies that this is a stateless session bean and that a container-managed transaction is required to execute each of its methods (in the figure these attributes are in boldface for ease of reading). For example, if we simply change the <TT>&lt;session-type&gt;</TT> field in the XML to read <TT>stateful</TT>, the container will manage the bean very differently. <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch16list08">Figure 16.13</A> shows the deployment descriptor for the <TT>Account</TT> entity bean. As well as the deployment attributes we have already seen, it tells the container the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">That it must manage persistence for beans of this type</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">Where to find the JDBC data source for the database</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">What primary key and data items must be mapped between the database and the entity bean</P></LI>
