<P class="docText">Perhaps the most important concept associated with software architecture documentation is the <span class="docEmphasis">view</span>. Recall from <A class="docLink" HREF="0321154959_ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A> that we defined a software architecture for a system as "the structure or structures of the system, which comprise elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them." And we said that a view is a representation of a coherent set of architectural elements, as written by and read by system stakeholders. A structure is the set of elements itself, as they exist in software or hardware.</P>
<P class="docText">Also in <A class="docLink" HREF="0321154959_ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A> we discussed a software architecture as a complex entity that cannot be described in a simple one-dimensional fashion. The analogy with building architecture, if not taken too far, proves illuminating. There is no single rendition of a building architecture but many: the room layouts, the elevation drawings, the electrical diagrams, the plumbing diagrams, the ventilation diagrams, the traffic patterns, the sunlight and passive solar views, the security system plans, and many others. Which of these views <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> the architecture? None of them. Which views <span class="docEmphasis">convey</span> the architecture? All of them.</P>
<P class="docText">The concept of a view, which you can think of as capturing a structure, provides us with the basic principle of documenting software architecture:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><P class="docList">Documenting an architecture is a matter of documenting the relevant views and then adding documentation that applies to more than one view.</P></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class="docText">This principle is useful because it breaks the problem of architecture documentation into more tractable parts, which provide the structure for the remainder of this chapter:</P>
