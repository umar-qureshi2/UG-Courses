<P class="docText">The ATAM is a robust method for evaluating software architectures. It works by having project decision makers and stakeholders articulate a precise list of quality attribute requirements (in the form of scenarios) and by illuminating the architectural decisions relevant to carrying out each high-priority scenario. The decisions can then be cast as risks or nonrisks to find any trouble spots in the architecture.</P>
<P class="docText">In addition to understanding what the ATAM is, it is also important to understand what it is not.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P class="docList">The ATAM is not an evaluation of requirements. That is, an ATAM-based evaluation will not tell anyone whether all of the requirements for a system will be met. It will discern whether gross requirements are satisfiable given the current design.</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">The ATAM is not a code evaluation. Because it is designed for use early in the life cycle, it makes no assumptions about the existence of code and has no provision for code inspection.</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">The ATAM does not include actual system testing. Again because the ATAM is designed for use early in the life cycle, it makes no assumptions of the existence of a system and has no provisions for any type of actual testing.</P></LI>
<LI><P class="docList">The ATAM is not a precise instrument, but identifies possible areas of risk within the architecture. These risks are embodied in the sensitivity points and the tradeoffs. The ATAM relies on the knowledge of the architect, and so it is possible that some risks will remain undetected. In addition, risks that are detected are not quantified. That is, there is no attempt to say that a particular sensitivity point will have a particular dollar value if not corrected. This final point will be addressed in <A class="docLink" HREF="0321154959_ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</A> when we discuss the Cost Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM).</P></LI>
</UL>
<P class="docText">We have participated in a large number of evaluations using the ATAM and taught and observed others performing them. In virtually every case, the reaction among the technical people being evaluated is amazement that so many risks can be found in such a short time. The reaction among management is that now they can understand why a particular technical issue threatens the achievement of their business goals. The ATAM has proven itself as a useful tool.</P>
