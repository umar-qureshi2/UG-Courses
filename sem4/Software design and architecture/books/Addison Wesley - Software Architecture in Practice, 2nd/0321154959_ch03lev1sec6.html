Propose the smallest subset of the A-7E software that still does something (correctly, in accordance with requirements) observable by the pilot. (A good candidate is displaying a value, such as current heading on some cockpit display.) Which modules do you need and which can you do without? Now propose three incremental additions to that subset and specify the development plan (i.e., which modules you need) for those.</P>

If the monitors detected a disparity between the stored or computed values and what they computed as the correct values, they would signal an error. Show how each of the A-7E's architectural structures would change to accommodate this design. If you add modules, state the information-hiding criteria for placing them in the module hierarchy.</P>
