<p class="docText">—James Russell Lowell</p></blockquote>
<P class="docText">As we have seen over and over, the software architecture for a system plays a central role in system development and in the organization that produces it. The architecture serves as the blueprint for both the system and the project developing it. It defines the work assignments that must be carried out by design and implementation teams and it is the primary carrier of system qualities such as performance, modifiability, and security—none of which can be achieved without a unifying architectural vision. Architecture is an artifact for early analysis to make sure that the design approach will yield an acceptable system. Moreover, architecture holds the key to post-deployment system understanding, maintenance, and mining efforts. In short, architecture is the conceptual glue that holds every phase of the project together for all of its many stakeholders.</P>
<P class="docText">Documenting the architecture is the crowning step to crafting it. Even a perfect architecture is useless if no one understands it or (perhaps worse) if key stakeholders misunderstand it. If you go to the trouble of creating a strong architecture, you <span class="docEmphasis">must</span> describe it in sufficent detail, without ambiguity, and organized in such a way that others can quickly find needed information. Otherwise, your effort will have been wasted because the architecture will be unusable.</P>
<P class="docText">This chapter will help you decide what information about an architecture is important to capture, and it will discuss guidelines for capturing it. It will also discuss notations that are available, including UML.</P>
